# Core Components

The core components of the library serve as the foundation for its capabilities. They are designed to be easily and quickly integrated, and follow specific guidelines to provide a solid base for further development.

Currently the core components include: [Actions](#Actions), [Steps](#Steps), [Policies](#Policies), [Strategies](#Strategies), [Conditions](#Conditions), and [Collectors](#Collectors).

The Core class manages the registration of new functions within the existing components.

**Component Requirements:**

- Components dictionary needs to be available before a simulation starts
- Easy extension with new component classes and functions
- Easy usage of components in the code
- Consistent and universal schema

## Actions
The primary way an object interacts with the simulation. 

***For Example:*** A Dooder **moves** from one location to another. The action in this case is [move](https://github.com/csmangum/Dooders/blob/main/sdk/actions/move.py)
