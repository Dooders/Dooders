# Society

***This page is a work-in-progress***

Each Dooder agent object is a component of the Society model.
You can think of that like a school of fish, you can examine the behavior of a single fish, or observe the behavior of the greater system, the school.

A benefit of a Society model is to evaluate the behavior of Dooders at a higher level that could exhibit emergent properties.
