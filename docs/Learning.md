# Learning

A majority of research will be spent experimenting with different methods and techniques for a Dooder to learn from the environment.

Basically, the Dooder agent will learn through its experiences and perceptions in the simulation. How that Dooder takes those experiences and perceptions and turns it into decisions, is the piece that willbe open to experimentation.

### Basic Example
Simple Neural network based movement. Driven by

Logic

Design


### Future Designs
Research more on:
- Baysieyan Neural Networks
- Feed-Forward Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning
- Graph Neural Networks
