# Learning

A main objective of the project is to explore the learning capabilities of Dooders within the environment. This requires systematic experimentation to evaluate various strategies and approaches for the Dooder to gather information from the simulation and apply it towards increasing its longevity.

In essence, the Dooder agent will exhibit learning through its exposure and interpretation of the simulated environment.

## Mind Models

A mind is a model for the way the Dooder experiences and acts in the simulation. How it perceives the environment and how it reacts to it.

### Example

A literal interpretation of the process of a mind is described below.



### Neural Networks

Simple Neural network based movement. Goal driven targets.
The weights and biases of a neural network serves as a form of genetic memory. Memory stored over iterations that is unaccessible to the Dooder. Although, the weights can be adjusted based on the Dooder's experiences and choices.

### Future Research

* Bayesian Neural Networks
* Feed-Forward Neural Networks
