# Learning

One of the primary goals of the project is to experiment how a Dooder can learn from the environment. This involves research dedicated to testing different methods and techniques for a Dooder to take information from the simulation and use it to extend its life.

Basically, the Dooder agent will learn through its experiences and perceptions in the simulation.

## Mind Models

A mind is a model for the way the Dooder experiences and acts in the simulation. How it perceives the environment and how it reacts to it.

### Example

A literal interpretation of the process of a mind is described below.



### Neural Networks

Simple Neural network based movement. Goal driven targets.
The weights and biases of a neural network serves as a form of genetic memory. Memory stored over iterations that is unaccessible to the Dooder. Although, the weights can be adjusted based on the Dooder's experiences and choices.

### Future Research

* Bayesian Neural Networks
* Feed-Forward Neural Networks
* Reinforcement Learning
