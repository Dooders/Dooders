# Why Dooders

I'm interested in how things work and in how information can be turned into knowledge and actions.

I like seeing how ideas and technologies can weave together in novel ways. For quite some time, I've wanted a personal project that allowed me to be curious and play around with different ideas.

I consider myself more of a generalist and I am curious in just about everything. In recent years I’ve focused more on breadth than depth, both of which have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Dooders is a project that combines many of my interests; and areas I want to explore more. I hope to create something that is continually improving and evolving.

The primary goals of the project are to:

1. Create a simulation sandbox deigned for continual experimentation
2. Gain a better intuition into the mechanics and behaviors of complex dynamical systems
3. Explore and discover methods to develop intelligent agents

In the near future, I believe there will be a new niche in AI development filled with bespoke intelligent agents (created for specific utility, traits, or tasks), available to everyone. Agents that are able to learn and think inside a dynamic and persistent digital environment.

The project will likely follow an evolutionary-like development trajectory; starting with simple implementations akin to single-celled bacteria, adding complexity to the environment and agent as far as I am able.

No matter the end result, I know I’m going to enjoy the ride.
