# Why Dooders

I'm fascinated by how things function and how information can be transformed into knowledge and action. I have been seeking a personal project that allows me to indulge my curiosity and experiment with different concepts.

I see myself as a generalist with a broad range of interests. In recent years, I've emphasized exploring many topics over a deep dive into one specific area, recognizing the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches (Specialization vs. Generalization)

This project aligns with my interests and provides an opportunity to explore more. I expect to create a continuously evolving and improving project.

I aim to explore and integrate various disciplines and fields into the project including: artificial intelligence, data science, philosophy, cognitive science, information theory, biology, etc., while attempting to create an elegent and clean codebase. Code can be as much an art as it is a science; communicating complex ideas better than traditional methods.

My primary objectives are to:

1. Develop a simulation sandbox that enables ongoing experimentation.
2. Improve my understanding of complex dynamical systems.
3. Investigate and discover methods for creating intelligent agents.

I believe in a future where bespoke intelligent agents, designed for specific purposes or tasks, will become accessible to everyone. These agents will be capable of learning and functioning within dynamic, persistent digital environments.

The development of the project will likely follow an evolutionary path, starting with basic implementations similar to single-celled organisms and gradually increasing the complexity of both the environment and the agents.

Regardless of the outcome, I'm excited for the journey.
