# Dooder

A Dooder is the primary agent object in the [simulation](Simulation.md). An agent is defined as an entity that has causal power, or has the ability to interact with its environment.[^1]

Another way of thinking about it is an agent can take in information and use that to increase its survivability. Naturally, an agent's causal power increases as its ability to evaluate information also increases.[^2]

A Dooder contains the following sub models:  

- [Behavior](Behavior.md)
- [Cognition](Cognition.md)
- [Genetics](Genetics.md)

A Dooder is also a component of higher level models like:  

- [Environment](Environment.md)
- [Society](Society.md)
- [Information](Information.md)
