# Dooder

## Conceptual Explanation

A Dooder is the primary agent in the system. An agent is defined as an entity that has causal power, or has the ability to interact with the physical world. Another way of thinking about it is an agent can take in information and use that to increase its survivability.

A Dooder contains the following sub components:

- Behavior
- Cognition
- Genetics

An individual Dooder is a sub component of Society, which represents the system of Dooders in the simulation.

You can think of that like a school of fish, you can examine the behavior of a single fish, or observe the behavior of the greater system, the school.
