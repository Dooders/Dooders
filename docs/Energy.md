# Energy

***This page is a work-in-progress***

Energy is an measure of the ability to do work. The more energy a Dooder can extract from the environment, the more it can do and the longer it can persist in the simulation.

A Dooder uses energy to move or perform actions. In the simulation, Dooders use energy to escape the equivalent of thermal equilibrium, terminal state. Thermal equilibrium as in a Dooder being removed from the simulation due to a terminal state (death). Following the second law of thermodynamics, a system will naturally tend toward equilibrium without energy (internally or externally sourced) (death or endness like a hurricane losing power until it dissipates)

## Types of Energy

### Simple Energy: 
Energy that is refreshed each cycle around the environment and can be consumed by all higher level energies.

### Local Energy: 
Energy that is locally bound in the environment that can be large but finite.

Also more difficult to extract this type of energy, but allows for large extractions over time

### Complex Energy: 
Energy with a limited ability to interact and learn that serves as an intermediary level where it consumes Simple Energy, but also can be consumed. This will give it predator-prey relationship with the Dooder agent.

Will be able to observe the evolution of this agent as well.
How it adapts to the Dooder dynamic.
I will also need to give this the ability to continue long into the simulation

## Highlights

* Used by dooders to move or perform actions
* Energy is added randomly at the start of each cycle
* Each Dooder has an energy supply
* After n cycles with no movement, 1 energy unit is taken from a dooder
* Energy dissipates at random intervals between min and max (laws)

## Future Ideas

* Energy creation cycles or periods. Like periods of plenty and scarcity
