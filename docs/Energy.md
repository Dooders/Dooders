# Energy

***This page is a work-in-progress***

Energy is an measure of the ability to do work. A Dooder uses energy to move or perform actions.

## Highlights

* Used by dooders to move or perform actions
* Energy is added randomly at the start of each cycle
* Each Dooder has an energy supply
* After n cycles with no movement, 1 energy unit is taken from a dooder
* Energy dissipates at random intervals between min and max (laws)

## Future

* Energy creation cycles or periods. Like periods of plenty and scarcity
* Different types of energy with advantages and disadvantages
* Maybe go into starvation state and behaves differently
* Emergency supply that is used when starving. Make this a gene

## Metrics

1. Total available energy
2. Average lifespan
3. Consumption rate

## Applicable configs
