# cognition module for dooders
#! might work like this:
# Dooder will predict the potential end-states and weight the different end-states
# based on it bringing the Dooder closer to the main goal end-state.
# Maximizing or minimizing a score. 
# Basically, choosing a predicted end-state
# Predictive value is a function of the amount of information potential (awareness)
# More awareness and less predictive error, the better the prediction to meet the goal
