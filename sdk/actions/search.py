# is this more of a strategy/policy than an action? Or maybe its both and thats good
# search for an object
# can I chain actions??? have a model to search in a model and model uses that result?
# Then would it be possible to have an agent that can chain actions???
# like get an action chain list that the dooder then executes in order
# maybe use a while clause to execute the actions in order to a limit. is there a thing like clock ticks? is that just the cpu timer?
# then I can have variable tick lengths and variable action lengths. Allows for a lot of variability
# digital versions of self?
#! chaining may be too complex, for now
