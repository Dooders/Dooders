> Reality works. Simulate it.  

A [Dooder](docs/Dooder.md) is an agent object in the simulation with an amount of causal control. It acts in the simulation only as long as it consumes [Energy](https://github.com/csmangum/Dooders/blob/main/docs/Energy.md).

### The Goal

By focusing on agents' ability to fit their environment and discover unrealized niches, the simulation aims to evolve agents with increasingly higher levels of agency, ultimately leading to more intelligent, adaptable, and capable entities.
