## Overview

Dooders is an open-source research project focused on the development of artificial intelligent agents in a simulated reality. The project aims to enable the conditions and mechanisms for cognitive agents to evolve and emerge in a open-ended and expanding environment.

A [Dooder](docs/Dooder.md) is an agent object in the simulation with an amount of causal control. It acts in the simulation only as long as it consumes [Energy](https://github.com/csmangum/Dooders/blob/main/docs/Energy.md).

### Research Objective

Ultimately, I want to better understand how an agent develops agency, how it can be measured, and how it can be optimized in a complex and dynamic simulation environment.

### Approach

1. **Define Agency**: Modeling from an Agent and Arena relationship, break down agency into key components such as autonomy, adaptability, problem-solving, social interaction, and self-regulation, resulting in a complex index score.
2. **Simulation Engine (TimeBandit)**: Create a dynamic environment where agents face diverse challenges and opportunities, including resource management, environmental changes, and social interactions.
3. **Evolutionary Algorithm (ContinuousEvolution)**: Use an evolutionary algorithm to drive agent selection. Agents with higher agency—demonstrated through better adaptation, problem-solving, and interaction—will be selected over those with lower agency. 
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Continuously measure and optimize agents' agency, driving them to discover and exploit new niches in the environment, enhancing their intelligence, adaptability, and overall effectiveness.

### Goal

By focusing on agents' ability to fit their environment and discover unrealized niches, the simulation aims to evolve agents with increasingly higher levels of agency, ultimately leading to more intelligent, adaptable, and capable entities.
