# Dooders UI

The goals of this section is to develop and design useful user interface elements and functions to fully explore complex systems provided through the sdk.  

Currently I am playing around using React with probably MUI. The backend is both FastAPI for a simple API to the SDK and Cube.js for all of the analytics and interfacing with the database (currently Postgres)  

Interface: React with MUI  
Backend API: FastAPI  
Analytics: Cube.js  
Database: Postgres
